1. Compile:

	~javac -cp "Source of Jar" (Ex:C://Users/Kennedy/Desktop/GridWorldCode/gridworld.jar) "Name of .java file"

2. Running:

	~java -cp .;"Source of Jar" (Ex:C://Users/Kennedy/Desktop/GridWorldCode/gridworld.jar) "Name of .java file"

Notes:

~ Running the file using java requires ".;" after "-cp" 
	"." = current directory
	";" = and
	"..." = moving back certain amount of directories (... is 3 directories up and so on)

~ Must set source of jar file before compiling and running
